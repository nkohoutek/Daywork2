<h1> Boulevard of Broken Dreams</h1>
<br>
<div>
I walk a lonely road<br>
The only one that I have ever known<br>
Don't know where it goes<br>
But it's home to me and I walk alone
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:yellow">
I walk this empty street<br>
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br>
Where the city sleeps<br>
and I'm the only one and I walk alone
</div>
<br>
<span>
I walk alone<br>
I walk alone
</span>

<span>
I walk alone<br>
I walk alone....<br>
</span>
<br>
<span style="background-color:yellow">
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me<br>
'Til then I walk alone
</span>
